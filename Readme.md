# KIReceiver
Beacon scanner and BLE device unlocker for iOS

Objective-C, ARC


## Getting Started

This project is designed to run together with [KIBroadcaster](https://github.com/alexfrangeti/KIBroadcaster)

Start KIBroadcaster on another device first, or if you use any other iBeacon application / device, do modify the constants at the top of the KIReceiverViewController.m file.

There are no external dependencies. Just open the KIReceiver.xcodeproject file in XCode, make sure you change the signing identity to something that allows you to run it on a device.
